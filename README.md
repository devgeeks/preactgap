# A PhoneGap app created with Preact


## Workflow

- `npm run dev`
  - start a local hot module replacement server at http://localhost:8080
- `npm run lint`
  - lint src and test folders using eslint
- `npm run build`
  - build static assets (JavaScript bundle, CSS and index.html) into `www`
  - After this a standard `phonegap run ios` etc will work
